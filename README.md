# text_to_image

Well hello again, in these times we all have used AI image-generating platforms like Meta AI, and DALL-E the main drawback of this kind of Image-generating is that we only have limited tokens. So, we used our model, which means the data you share does not go out of your system. Let's try the model.

The library we have used :
1. Diffusers
2. Torch

step 1: we manually install the Diffusers using the command (please note that we use ! pip not pip because collab has some different config)

step 2: This is a simple code for the body to process

!!!! please note that the Runtime should be set to T4GPU to accelerate the process...

This is a simple process so just follow these steps:
1. Download
2. Upload
3. Use Generate

The photo generated will be set in the runtime files.
